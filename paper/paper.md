## Introduction to IBM Watson

IBM Watson is one such intelligent data analysis and visualization service on the cloud that lets anybody pose different questions and provides answers to the questions posed in natural language. IBM Watson provides all the tools and services necessary to work with your data and build machine learning models at one place which makes analyzing data much simple be it a novice or an expert. IBM Watson offers numerous services namely Watson Analytics, Visual Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Tone Analyzer, Language Translator, Machine Learning etc.

## IBM Watson Analytics

IBM Watson Analytics is one such service that enables extracting intricate data flow processes as well as convoluted relationships between different fields of data. The analytics services offered by IBM Watson not only enables you to discover novel insights about an organization but also swiftly create and share highly informative and illustrative dashboards and infographics. The Watson Analytics is also capable of analyzing data directly from social platforms like Twitter and output the sentiment of the customer or learn the best time to tweet to enhance the span of the audience. It also enables multiple users to collaborate and share visualizations and dashboards with each other.

## IBM Watson Machine Learning

IBM Watson Machine Learning is another powerful service which is integrated to IBM Watson Studio that enables users to perform two fundamental operations of machine learning i.e. training and scoring. Training is the process of teaching an algorithm the underlying trends and behavior of data by feeding labelled data to the algorithm. A trained algorithm learns coefficients of mathematical expressions which represent the behavior of the data in the best possible way. Scoring is the process of predicting an output using the coefficients learned from the trained algorithm which is otherwise called as a predictive model. These predictions made by the algorithms after scoring enables data scientists to collaborate with data engineers to further explore the data and gain deeper insights out of it.

## Conclusion

To sum up, IBM Watson is an ideal tool if you want to perform your own analysis but perplexed where to begin. IBM Watson is a smart data discovery tool that enables you to leverage all the state-of-the-art data analytics and visualization techniques to draw valuable insights out of data almost instantly. It automates the processes such as data preparation, predictive modeling, and data visualization which are otherwise very hectic and tedious processes.
